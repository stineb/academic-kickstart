* I got my project MIND funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation with an Eccellenza grant. This means I'll be starting as an Assistant Prof. at ETH ZÃ¼rich and WSL in September this year. I'm looking for a Postdoc to start around September too, and two Ph.D. students a year later. More info is following...
* Come see our session at EGU 2019: [Session BG2.15: Terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change: integrating experiments and models to understand carbon, nutrient, and water cycling](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/32161)
* Our paper on how soil moisture droughts affect global GPP and its variability is accepted in Nature Geosciences. Get a preprint here soon.
