* New paper on carbon-water coupling across scales published in *Nature Geoscience*. More info [here](/project/soilm_global/).
* I got my project MIND funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation with an Eccellenza grant. This means I'll be starting as an Assistant Prof. at ETH ZÃ¼rich and WSL in September this year. I'm looking for a Postdoc to start around September too, and two Ph.D. students a year later. More info [here](/mind/).
* Come see our session at EGU 2019: [Session BG2.15: Terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change: integrating experiments and models to understand carbon, nutrient, and water cycling](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/session/32161).
* Planned visiting researcher stay in [Prof. Rob Jackson's Lab](https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, US. starting in April 2019.
